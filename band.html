			<p>Blender named them No. 420 on their Top 100 Hot Report in September 2007, before they released any official material. The group has toured with Panic! at the Disco, We the Kings, Metro Station, The Higher, Cobra Starship, There For Tomorrow, Jessica Poland, Forever the Sickest Kids, Dashboard Confessional, Plain White T's, The Hush Sound, and others. In February 2008, their touring van turned over in Wisconsin, but none of the members were seriously injured, and they only missed one tour date. In March 2008, the band played SXSW.</p>

				<p>On June 1, 2009 lead singer Alexander DeLeon announced on his blog that guitarist Ian Crawford had decided to leave the band. Although DeLeon did say that Crawford had decided to leave due to creative differences, there seemed to be no animosity between him and the band. For their then-upcoming What Happens in Vegas... tour, The Cab announced that their friend Bryan Dawson would be replacing Ian Crawford, who soon became the touring guitarist of Panic! at the Disco.</p>

				<p>On August 19, 2009, bassist Cash Colligan announced that he would also be leaving the band.[25] The news of Colligan's split first appeared on The Cab's official MySpace blog. Colligan's departure, like Crawford's, seemed to be amicable as the band wrote, "We wish him the best and I'm sure he'll be no stranger at a Cab show or anytime we're back in town." The same day Colligan posted his own explanation for leaving the band on his official MySpace blog. He wrote, "I'm proud as a founding member of this band to say the things I've done, the people I've met and the friends I've made. After five years it's time for me to take a mental nap. Being home I can collect my thoughts and move forward." Colligan went on to say that he would be settling down in Las Vegas and that now is just not the right time for him to be touring on the road.</p>
